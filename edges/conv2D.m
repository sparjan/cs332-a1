function conv = conv2D(image, operator)
% conv = conv2D(image, operator)
% Convolves the input 2D image with an input 2D convolution operator that 
% is assumed to be square, with an odd number of rows and columns. Returns 
% a 2D matrix of the same size as the input image, storing the convolution 
% result. No convolution values are computed for a border around the outer 
% edge of the image that is half the operator size
